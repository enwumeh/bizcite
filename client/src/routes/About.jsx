      <p class="about-p">It all started when I was gifted Pink Friday by Nicki Minaj Perfume and was OBSESSED. When it finished (shortly after),  I looked for more and stumbled across  an inexpensive body oil that claimed to smell just like Pink Friday. I was surprised to find out how similar it was, and how much longer it lasted. And I got compliments constantly! Since then I've sworn by oil fragrances, and want to spread the love </p>
