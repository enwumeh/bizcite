        It all started when I was gifted Pink Friday by Nicki Minaj Perfume and
        was OBSESSED. When it finished (shortly after), I looked for more and
        stumbled across an inexpensive body oil that claimed to smell just like
        Pink Friday. I was surprised to find out how similar it was, and how
        much longer it lasted. And I got compliments constantly! Since then I've
        sworn by oil fragrances, and want to spread the love
        <br />
        <br />
        All fragrances are hand filled, and made with tried and true, name brand
        fragrances in mind. Smell amazing all day for just a fraction of the
        price. Find your new signature scent!
